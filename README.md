# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe Game written in C++, developed as part of the teaching materials for the Fundamentals of Programming course.

The use of straightforward and easy-to-understand syntax in this code is intentional, as it aligns with the educational goal of helping beginners grasp core programming concepts without being overwhelmed by complex language features. By focusing on clear logic and fundamental structures, this implementation serves as an excellent tool for students to learn and practice essential programming skills, such as loops, conditionals, and basic game mechanics. 

## Features

- Two-player mode
- Simple text-based interface
- Validates moves and checks for win conditions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/armanheidari/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
   cd Tic-Tac-Toe
   ```

2. Compile the code:
   ```sh
   g++ -o tic_tac_toe main.cpp
   ```

### Running the Game

After compiling, you can run the game with the following command:
```sh
./tic_tac_toe
```

### How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) on the grid.
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game is a draw.
